We tried several prototypes with the idea of having only the \u0026ldquo;tapping\u0026rdquo; input available. G!RO is the result of one of those prototypes.\nIn G!RO you are in control of a spaceship that has lost one of its motors and spins endlessly while trapped in an unknown planet. Your role is to survive for as long as possible using your main weapon for movement and defense.\nMy role in G!RO # As we started testing different concepts, we needed tools to iterate fast. I was in charge of researching the most commonly used features of hypercasual games, designing and developing an in-engine tool that provided most of the implementations hypercasual-arcade games for mobile usually need, while being fully customizable. The tool is fully interchangeable between different games, supports 2D and 3D and only requires minimum configuration to work. This means: Menu functionality (responsive, provided default menus and means to customize them). Store Player selection Inventories Ads and IAPs (In-App purchases) Several minor implementations (volume buttons, basic graphical quality settings) Hard \u0026amp; soft currency Hooks menu\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;game so all the developer had to do was listen to specific events (e.g. starting the game) Saving/Loading locally (playerprefs, encrypted/unencrypted JSON) Improving gameplay feedback: Dynamically displaying current user weapon charge, limiting UI and implementing it into the game design. Screen shake Creating a procedural world different for each playthrough Implementing different biomes made by the artists Implementing different spaceship types/weapons Optimizing game world so the game could be played in low-end games Bug fixing Honorable mentions # Awarded \u0026ldquo;Most enjoyable game\u0026rdquo; @ Indie Burger Awards, hosted at BIG, formerly Fun\u0026amp;Serious Bilbao Nomination for \u0026ldquo;Best old school arcade game\u0026rdquo; @ Indie Burger Awards, hosted at BIG, formerly Fun\u0026amp;Serious Bilbao ","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/projects/gro/","section":"Projects","summary":"This game is playable on itch.","title":"G!RO"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/languages/","section":"Languages","summary":"","title":"Languages"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/tags/personal-project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Personal project"},{"content":"\n","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/engines/unity/","section":"Engines","summary":"","title":"Unity"},{"content":" This game is playable on Google Play and App Store\rTry this game!

Dynamic obstacle generation Dynamic difficulty (changing per time) Changed base game architecture to support the addition of several new characters, part of the DLC.\nMofified all base game minigames so they could support new player selected characters.\nImplemented soft coins that players can use to buy ingame items.\nModified bath minigame so it could fit new items.\nModified clothing minigame so all player-selectable characters can wear any kind of clothing.\nModified \u0026ldquo;plant growing\u0026rdquo; minigame so the player could use more seeds, with new kinds of trees and fruits dropping from them.\nImplemented design team\u0026rsquo;s requests throughout the game.\nCreated in-engine tool so the design team could easily implement new stories in the style of visual novel games, which was a completely new part of the game.\nHonorable mentions # Nadurines currently has a positive rating in both Android and Apple Stores +500.000 downloads ","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/projects/nadurines/","section":"Projects","summary":"This game is playable on Google Play and App Store\rTry this game!","title":"Nadurines"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/tags/professional-project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Professional project"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/languages/assimp/","section":"Languages","summary":"","title":"Assimp"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/languages/c++/","section":"Languages","summary":"","title":"C++"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/engines/game-engine-architecture/","section":"Engines","summary":"","title":"Game Engine Architecture"},{"content":"\rWhat is this engine? # Since I started making games, I\u0026rsquo;ve been deeply intrigued in the inner workings of more commercial engines. This was my first iteration of a game engine.\nIt supports 2D and 3D graphics using SDL2 for 2D and CPU rendering for 3D. The engine supports physics via a implementation of Box2D (2D) and Bullet Physics (3D).\nThe engine is built around an ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture.\nLoronsoDev/GameEngine2\rSecond version of my yet-unnamed game engine. Can support 3D and 2D. Implements Bullet Physics for 3D and Box2D for 2D development. This engine is highly commented and valuable as a learning tool. It is not being worked on.\rC\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 0\r0\rWhy do I consider this project important? # This project set my stepping stone to larger projects involving graphics and general game engine programming. It sparked enough curiosity in me to continue studying code architecture, computer graphics and proper GPU APIs like OpenGL or Vulkan.\nWhy did I stop working on it? # At a point in its development, the engine needed reflection so I could translate the custom scene files into scenes that could be generated at runtime. I considered that instead of trying to implement it, I could just stop the work there, document everything clearly and use it for future reference in other engines if needed. I started working in this engine as a newbie with C++, so I feared that if I started implementing my own custom C++ reflection or any other reflection API, the engine could become so convoluted that I would no longer be able to maintain it properly. I preferred to have a working build that could be used by me or others for learning and start a new project from scratch using what I learnt while building this engine.\n","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/projects/engine-sdl/","section":"Projects","summary":"What is this engine?","title":"My first (unnamed) Game Engine"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 1970","permalink":"/languages/sdl2/","section":"Languages","summary":"","title":"SDL2"},{"content":" This game is playable on itch.io\rTry this game!\rWhat is FADE? # FADE was a video game created in 4 days as part of Telefonica\u0026rsquo;s hackathon \u0026ldquo;HackForGood\u0026rdquo;.
