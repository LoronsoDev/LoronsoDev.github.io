## What is PRE TRIP INSPECTION?
Pre Trip Inspection is an immersive training system for professional drivers adapted to US regulations. The solution was created “ad hoc” for the North American company Advanced Training Systems LLC (ATS), a leading company in the virtual training sector for carriers.

This app offers a revolutionary quick, precise and easy training system, which streamlines the training of drivers both in risk prevention and in obtaining specific certifications and licenses, allowing users to choose between training in virtual reality mode or in augmented reality according to your needs.

## My role in PRE TRIP INSPECTION
I was part of the team as an intern.

- Implemented Vuforia's SDK for AR viewing using AR cards.

- Implemented different modes, like "evaluation" mode, that did an exam to the user, or "practice" mode, that asked the users the same question as evaluation mode, but was infinite.

- Developed shaders for outlining different parts of the truck body.

- Implemented different viewing modes (buttons and swiping)

- Created in-engine tool to add/remove questions easily.

- Implemented different camera movements so the camera didn't clip through the truck if not necessary.
