## What is Nadurines?
Nadurines is a minigame-based game for children. I was part of the development of one of its DLC.

## My role in Nadurines
 - Developed "lights" minigame, a time management minigame where you have to avoid leaving lights on when there isn't anyone inside.

- Developed "runer" minigame, where the player needs to avoid obstacles for as long as possible.
    - Developed unique superpowers for each of the characters.
    - Dynamic obstacle generation
    - Dynamic difficulty (changing per time)

- Changed base game architecture to support the addition of several new characters, part of the DLC.

- Mofified all base game minigames so they could support new player selected characters.

- Implemented soft coins that players can use to buy ingame items.
- Modified bath minigame so it could fit new items.

- Modified clothing minigame so all player-selectable characters can wear any kind of clothing.

- Modified "plant growing" minigame so the player could use more seeds, with new kinds of trees and fruits dropping from them.

- Implemented design team's requests throughout the game.

- Created in-engine tool so the design team could easily implement new stories in the style of visual novel games, which was a completely new part of the game.

 #### Honorable mentions
 - Nadurines currently has a positive rating in both Android and Apple Stores
 - +500.000 downloads
