## What is FADE?
FADE was a video game created in 4 days as part of Telefonica's hackathon "HackForGood". The goal of the event was to create pieces of software that could be used for the greater good, in any way.

We chose to create a short story based on an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer. Our objective was to raise awareness around this issue, getting our players to play as her.

It's important to note that video games for this event were strictly in the category of "serious games", which led to us making some modifications in the way the game was handled and played.

## My role in FADE

​
